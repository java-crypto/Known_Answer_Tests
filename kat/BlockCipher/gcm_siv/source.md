The testvectors were taken from the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8452 document.

The files with "SIV_org.txt" in the end do have the original strings packaged in 16 byte long blocks.

For an easy reading I removed the packaging in the files "...SIV.txt" so there is a single line for every value.
